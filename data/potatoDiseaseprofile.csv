Common Scab,Streptomyces spp.,Tubers,,,"Tan to dark brown, circular or irregular lesions; rough texture; types: superficial (russet scab), slightly raised (erumpent scab), sunken (pitted scab)",Controlled at soil pH levels of 5.2 or lower,Closely related species (acid scab) can survive at pH levels down to 4.0,Not temperature-specific,High soil pH levels; low organic matter in soil; certain potato cultivars; environmental conditions,20-25°C,5.2-7.5,60-80%,Moderate to high,Airborne
Early Blight,Alternaria solani,Foliage,Tubers,,"Dark, sunken, and circular lesions on tubers; bordered by purple to gray raised tissue; underlying flesh is dry, leathery, and brown",,Usually affects foliage but can infect tubers too,"Prefers warm, wet conditions",Extended periods of wetness; poor air circulation in foliage,24-29°C,5.5-7.0,80-100%,Moderate,Soil borne
Fusarium Dry Rot,Fusarium spp.,Tubers,,,"Internal light to dark brown or black dry rot; develops at injury sites; extensive rotting causes tissue to shrink and collapse, dark sunken area outside",,Often rots out the center of the tuber,Can develop at a wide range of temperatures,Entry through wounds or bruises on tubers; poor storage conditions,15-20°C,5.5-7.0,60-80%,Moderate,Insects
Black Dot,Colletotrichum coccodes,Foliage,Tubers,,"Nearly indistinguishable from early blight on foliage; tiny black sclerotia on tubers, visible under a 10X lens",,Symptoms on tubers can be mistaken for silver scurf,"Warm, moist conditions",High humidity; poor air circulation; infected plant debris in soil,25-30°C,5.5-7.0,80-100%,Moderate,Herbivors
Silver Scurf,Helminthosporium solani,Tuber periderm (skin),,,"Lesions start as small pale brown spots at the stolon end, darken and develop in storage; skin may slough off, tubers dry out and wrinkle",,"Lesions can coalesce to form large affected areas, leading to excessive moisture loss in storage","Prefers cool, moist conditions",Poor storage conditions; high humidity during storage; infected seed tubers,10-20°C,5.5-7.0,80-100%,Low to moderate,
Black Scurf,Rhizoctonia solani,Tubers,Underground Sprouts,Stolons,"Irregular black hard masses on tuber surface (sclerotia); dark sunken lesions on underground sprouts and stolons, cankers on tubers",Minimized by harvesting soon after vine-kill and skin set,"Sclerotia are overwintering structures; lesions cut off nutrient supply, can kill tubers or reduce their size","Cool, wet soil conditions","Poor crop rotation; infected soil; planting in cold, wet soils",10-25°C,5.5-7.0,60-80%,Low to moderate,
Rhizoctonia Canker,Rhizoctonia solani,Tubers ,Underground Sprouts,Stolons,"Irregular black hard masses on tuber surface (sclerotia); dark sunken lesions on underground sprouts and stolons, cankers on tubers",Minimized by harvesting soon after vine-kill and skin set,"Sclerotia are overwintering structures; lesions cut off nutrient supply, can kill tubers or reduce their size","Cool, wet soil conditions","Poor crop rotation; infected soil; planting in cold, wet soils",10-25°C,5.5-7.0,60-80%,Low to moderate,
Pink Rot,Phytophthora erythroseptica,Tubers ,,,"Rotten and discolored periderm starting at stolon end, flesh turns pink then brown-black when exposed to air",,Clear delineation between healthy and diseased tissue,"Cool, wet conditions",High soil moisture; infected plant debris in soil,12-20°C,5.5-7.0,80-100%,Low to moderate,
Pythium Leak,Pythium spp.,Tubers ,,,"Internal watery, gray or brown rot with well-defined red-brown lines; infections start at harvest wounds",,Infections continue to develop in transit and storage,"Cool, moist conditions",Entry through harvest wounds; high soil moisture; poor storage conditions,10-25°C,5.5-7.0,80-100%,Low to moderate,
Brown Center,Environmental Stress (Moisture),Tubers ,,,Brown center: brown tissue forming in the center of the tuber; Hollow heart: internal cavity within the tuber,Closer spacing and avoiding skips in rows,"More prone in large tubers; high incidence after periods of stress due to soil moisture fluctuations; variety susceptibility: 'Atlantic' is relatively susceptible, 'Russet Burbank' is most susceptible soon after tuber initiation",Not temperature-specific,High or low soil moisture; sudden heavy rains after dry spell; large tuber size; poor planting density; stress periods during tuber development,10-25°C,5.5-7.0,60-80%,Moderate,
